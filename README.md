The package includes a pre-built scene that showcases all its features.

# ðŸš€ | Set-up
To properly set up the navigation system, follow these steps or watch the tutorial video here:
- Create an empty GameObject and attach **PedestrianSystemController.cs** to it.
- Configure the attached script as desired. A description of each parameter is provided here on GitHub or by hovering over the variables in the Inspector.
- Create a new node by clicking the **"Add node to the scene"** button in the Inspector.
- Duplicate and position the newly created node to design the pedestrian path. Ensure all nodes are children of the same GameObject.
- For each node, specify its adjacent nodes in the Inspector. If everything is set up correctly, green lines indicating the path will appear.
