# ðŸ“¦ | Pedestrian Navigation System
**Pedestrian Navigation System** is a versatile Unity package for pedestrian simulation, offering a simple setup and customizable behavior.
It utilizes a node-based navigation system.

The package includes a pre-built scene that showcases all its features.

# ðŸš€ | Set-up
To properly set up the navigation system, follow these steps or watch the tutorial video here:
- Create an empty GameObject and attach **PedestrianSystemController.cs** to it.
- Configure the attached script as desired. A description of each parameter is provided here on GitHub or by hovering over the variables in the Inspector.
  - The script also needs a pedestrian prefab. You can assign the one provided with the package or create your own. To do that, just create a gameobject and assign **PedestrianSystemMover.cs** to it.
- Create a new node by clicking the **"Add node to the scene"** button in the Inspector.
- Duplicate and position the newly created node to design the pedestrian path. Ensure all nodes are children of the same GameObject.
- For each node, specify its adjacent nodes in the Inspector. If everything is set up correctly, green lines indicating the path will appear.

# ðŸ”Ž | Scripts Overview
The package contains 4 scripts:
- **PedestrianSystemController.cs** The main script used to configure the navigation system.
- **PedestrianSystemMover.cs** Attached to the pedestrian, this script is responsible for moving pedestrians along the path. It does not require any values to be set.
- **PedestrianSystemNode.cs** Attached to each node, this script defines the path.
- **PedestrianSystemUI.cs** This script doesn't need to be attached to any object. It provides UI elements that make the inspector values more readable.

Below is a description of each parameter in PedestrianSystemController.cs:
- **Pedestrian Prefab**. The prefab of your pedestrian.
- **Minimum Speed**. The minimum speed at which pedestrians can move. Each pedestrian's speed is a random value between **Minimum Speed** and **Maximum Speed**.
- **Maximum Speed**. The maximum speed at which pedestrians can move. Each pedestrian's speed is a random value between **Minimum Speed** and **Maximum Speed**.
- **Pedestrian Number**. The number of pedestrians that will be generated.
- **Has Wait Time (Bool)**. Determines whether pedestrians should wait a certain amount of time at each node.
- **Minimum Wait Time**. The minimum time a pedestrian waits at each node. The wait time is a random value between **Minimum Wait Time** and **Maximum Wait Time**.
- **Maximum Wait Time**. The maximum time a pedestrian waits at each node. The wait time is a random value between **Minimum Wait Time** and **Maximum Wait Time**.
- **Use Random Color**. Determines whether the pedestrian's material will be generated with a different color each time (useful for representing different skin tones).
- **Colors (List)**. A list of colors that can be used for the pedestrian's material.
- **Nodes Parent**. The GameObject that serves as the parent of all nodes.
